# Getting Started #

----------

The DEVUNA repositories contain source code written in and for [Clarion for Windows®](http://www.SoftVelocity.com)

Our repositories utilize the same folder structure as Clarion for Windows®.  Here is a list or the repository folders and their typical location in Clarion for Windows® version 10:

documents - CSIDL\_COMMON_DOCUMENTS/Softvelocity/Clarion10/Accessory/Devuna/documents/[project name] (e.g. CoolTips)

examples - CSIDL\_COMMON_DOCUMENTS/SoftVelocity/Clarion10/Accessory/Devuna/examples/[project name]

images - SoftVelocity/Clarion10/Accessory/images

libsrc/win - SoftVelocity/Clarion10/Accessory/libsrc/win

template/win - SoftVelocity/Clarion10/Accessory/template/win

Many of our projects rely on a common set of templates and include files.  These are provided in the [DEVUNA-COMMON](https://github.com/Devuna/Devuna-Common) repository, and, if you intend to utilize the code in our other repositories it would be a good idea to **pull the DEVUNA-COMMON repository first**.

Once you have registered the KCRCHAIN template there is one more **IMPORTANT STEP** to complete the installation.
There is a UTILITY template, **SupportABC**, that **MUST BE RUN after each Clarion patch that you install**. This utility will prepare your version of Clarion for use with Devuna ABC Templates. You will need to know the path to where your version of Clarion is installed.
